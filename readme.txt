                Description
---------------------------------------------

this is a repository for different devlopment tools
and spurious one-offs which don't warrant a repo all their own

currently contains:
  • wv_gen
    • language: python
    • purpose:  to generate an ordered table comprised of a list of samples
      representing a single cycle of a waveform
      as determined by some arbitrary function
      (currently a nonscaled, nonshifted linear polynomial)
      (y = x) - for linear envelope curve
      
  • freq_gen
    • language: python
    • purpose:  to generate an ordered table comprised of a list of frequencies
      expressed as integers, scaled exponentially as per the 12TET scale
